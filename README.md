# open-net
a way of doing a decentralized network across the world.



## Concept
Have a decentralized network across the globe that allows for high-speed internet to anywhere on the planet with the only costs being a token that pays for internet. That token is payed directly to the people who supply the bandwidth that you are using.



## Things to do
1. Figure out netework futures with some sort of token
2. eMail large telcos
3. write code
4. invest
5. keep on emailing



## Portals
Portals are how networks conne ct to each other, meaning that although it can and should be a physical fiber line between open-net participants, it can be a VPN portal allowing open-net Portallers to operate their portal nodes far from other portal nodes, potentially using a standard ISP while still helping the community, and earning [Net-Coin.](./net-coin.md)
